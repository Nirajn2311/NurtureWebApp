# NurtureWebApp

This is a full stack web app being developed for Nurture..

## Setup Instructions:

1. Clone this repository on your system.  
2. Create a new file in the config directory named .env and add the following:
   PORT = whatever port you want (3000)
   MONGO_DATABASE_NAME = the DB you want
   ATLAS_USERNAME = 
   ATLAS_PASSWORD = 
3. Check if node and npm are installed on your system.
4. Ensure that you have a mongoDB server running on your system and connect it to the mongoDB ATLAS using the credentials..
4. Run npm install from the server directory of the project.
5. Run npm run server from your command line and the server starts on your specified port.

Since the frontend is not there yet, use Postman to test the API.
